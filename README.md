Project overview: 
This project shows you how to enable communication between hardware and software to create an embedded system.
Case study: A multiplier block implemented in hardware that carries the operation of multiplication on two values.
The software is for writing the inputs and receiving the outputs from the hardware block.

How to build and run: 
Basic instructions on compiling or running the code
- Start by connecting blocks on Vivado
- Connect the PS to two axi gpios and a multiplier (picture is shown in another document)

Project structure: Explanation of key folders and files (like where hardware files or source code live)
- Hardware files containing the entire block connection is the
- Source files containing the processing system

Dependencies: What tools, libraries, or versions you need (e.g., Vitis version, compiler)
- I used Vitis and Vivado 2023.1

Usage: How to use your software or hardware platform
